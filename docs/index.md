# MRF

This is a `Sentier` model of an _material recover facility_ (MRF) in the US context. These facilities receive mixed municipal solid waste and through different means separate recyclables. The composition of the recyclables depends on the composition of the waste stream coming in. We have different waste compositions per county in US. As part of the model. 

The model is a subset of the [CELAVI](https://github.com/NREL/celavi) model by NREL
