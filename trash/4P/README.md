Plastic Parallel Pathways Platform (4P)

4P is a flexible material flow model capable of analyzing the effects of both plastic-to-plastic and plastic-to-x EoL management strategies on the U.S. PET bottle economy. The model assesses the environmental impacts, costs, and circularity of a PET bottle system in which waste is managed through six potential EoL pathways: landfill, incineration with energy recovery, pyrolysis to fuel oil, upcycling to glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP), mechanical recycling to low-grade PET, and chemical recycling (glycolysis) to food-grade PET.
